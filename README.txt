This is a starwars spaceship shooting game.
Left and Right to move the millenium falcon left and right. A (on keyboard "z") to fire laser.
Laser has a maximum continuity of 3 shots, it has a small delay after every 3 shots.
Enemy has the same delay for firing lasers. 
The boss is the death star, which has same delay but more ammo capacity (8).

I believe there is still some bugs to fix. But so far I have fixed everything I could find.
Music is created with Andrew's program GBA-tracker. Its referenced from Starwars Imperial March.
